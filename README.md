# bfu

![](demo.gif)

bfu is an interactive command-line brainfuck debugger with support for breakpoints and watchpoints, undoing and redoing instructions, and more. It may also operate in interpreter and preprocessor modes.

I wrote it as a joke in my student years, and to be honest I have no idea what the hell is going on in the source code. Though it seems I added some documentation.

Run `bfu -h` for command-line options.

Run `bfu -m` or `pod2man bfu | man -l -` to view the man page, or see [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md).
